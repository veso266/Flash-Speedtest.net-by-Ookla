If you create a new Flex Builder library project and point it at this folder, and then 
add ../lib to the source path, this should compile a swc file for you to use in your 
projects.  These are less flexible because you can't easily fix bugs without recompiling 
the swc, but as Modest Maps gets more stable it will cut the build time of your projects
a lot!
