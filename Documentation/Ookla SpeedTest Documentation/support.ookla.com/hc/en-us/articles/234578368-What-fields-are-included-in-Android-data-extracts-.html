</tr>
<tr>
<td>android_device_id</td>
<td>A unique ID specific to a device. Android device IDs are derived from the device's IMEI and anonymized with a private hash key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>android_fingerprint</em></td>
<td>Similar to a user agent string in a desktop browser, Android fingerprint describes the operating system build details and version. The fingerprint string isn't standardized and is easily modified by custom versions of Android. Rather than Android fingerprint, rely on the <span class="kb-code inline">device</span> and <span class="kb-code inline">hardware</span> fields for accurate information about the device hardware.</td>

<td>The date and time the test occurred, recorded in Pacific Time (GMT -8) by default. The time zone can be easily changed upon request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>client_ip_address</td>
<td>The first three octets of the user's external IP address. This is the IP address from which the request to Ookla's reporting API was generated. Devices on networks with any kind of NAT may appear to share the same IP address.</td>

How each country is divided into regions varies country to country, but this is typically the top level region as described in ISO-3166-2. If this field is labeled unknown and the field <span class="kb-code inline">location_type</span> equals 2, we were unable to confidently assign a region to the record and the location is only accurate to the country level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>client_region_code</td>
<td>The ISO-3166-2 region code of where the test was conducted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>client_city</td>
<td>The city where the test was conducted. If this field is labeled unknown and the <span class="kb-code inline">location_type</span> field equals 2, we were unable to confidently assign a city to the record and is only accurate to the region level.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>miles_between</td>
<td>The approximate distance between the device and the test server, measured in miles.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>network_operator_name</em></td>
<td>The name of the network operator, as displayed by the device. This field is generally accurate, but is not reliable. Custom versions of Android, including carrier specific versions, may modify this string, and carriers have used different spellings and brandings on their network names. For reliable network name detection, use the <span class="kb-code inline">network_operator</span> field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>network_operator</em></td>
<td>A combination of the MCC and MNC of the current registered network, as reported by the device. In wifi results, the MCC and MNC of the last registered network are used if available. A fairly comprehensive list of network operator codes can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code#National_operators">here</a>, but each country regulates their MNCs individually, so codes may appear or change without any notice.</td>
</tr>

<td>The Android build ID reflects the version of Android installed on the device. The build ID typically follows a standard convention of AAA##A, but some device manufacturers chose to implement their own convention. More information about Android build IDs can be found at https://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>manufacturer</em></td>
<td>The device manufacturer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>model</em></td>
<td>The device model number.</td>
</tr>

<td>See base_station_id.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>gsm_cell_id</em></td>
<td>See cid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>location_type</td>
<td>The method used to determine the device's location. Whenever possible, the speedtest.net mobile application uses the device's location services to determine an accurate latitude and longitude of the device. However, in an effort to maintain a quick and easy user experience, if the device's location services are either unavailable or unable to return an accurate location within a few seconds, we fall back to using third party Geo-IP location services. 1 = GPS / device location services, 2 = Geo-IP.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>sim_network_operator_name</em></td>
<td>Similar to the <span class="kb-code inline">network_operator_name</span> field, this is the network operator name associated with the sim card installed in the device, rather than the current network the device is registered on. Some devices may report null if the network associated with the sim is the same as the current registered network.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>sim_network_operator</em></td>
<td>Similar to the <span class="kb-code inline">network_operator</span> field, this is the network operator associated with the sim card installed in the device, rather than the current network the device is registered on. Some devices may report null if the network associated with the sim is the same as the current registered network.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pre_connection_type</td>
<td>A number representing the device's connection type as detected before the test begins. Please see the connection type table for an explanation of each type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>signal</em></td>
<td>Comma separated numeric signal data for carrier formatted as CdmaDbm,CdmaEcio,EbdoDbm,EvdoEcio,EvdoSnr,GsmBitErrorRate,GsmSignalStrength. Please note, while still available, this field has been superseded by the signal fields detailed below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>test_type</td>
<td>The communication protocol used by the test. Whenever possible, the test makes a direct TCP connection with the testing server, which allows for greater testing accuracy, especially at higher speeds. In instances where the device is unable to establish a TCP connection with the test server on the appropriate port, the test falls back to using basic HTTP file transfers to determine the device's bandwidth. 1 = HTTP, 2 = TCP.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>signal_cell_type</td>
<td>This field reflects the network connection type associated with the signal and cell information provided by the device. The signal cell type may differ from the connection type in cases where voice communications occur on a different network than data transmission. 1 = GSM, 2 = CDMA, 3 = WCDMA, 4 = LTE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>mcc</em></td>
<td>Mobile Country Code. A three digit code specific to the country where the network operator is located. A list of code and countries can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code#National_operators">here</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>mnc</em></td>
<td>Mobile Network Code. A three digit identifier specific to a network operator within a given country. When combined with the Mobile Country Code, each mobile network can be uniquely identified. A fairly comprehensive list of Mobile Network Codes can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code#National_operators">here</a>, but each country regulates their MNCs individually, so codes may appear or change without any notice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>pci</em></td>
<td>LTE Physical Cell Identity. An integer to identify the physical LTE cell the user is connected to. The value is unique to the physical cell antennae rather than a specific cell tower. Valid values are 0 to 503. A value of 65535 or null indicates that the device was unable to return a PCI value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>tac</em></td>
<td>LTE Tracking Area Code. A 16 bit integer used to facilitate handoff of a device between cells. The Tracking Area Identity can be determined by prepending the MCC and MNC to the Tracking Area Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>base_station_id</em></td>
<td>CDMA Base Station ID. Valid values range from 0 to 65535, with 65535 representing unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>station_latitude</em></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>cid</em></td>
<td>GSM, WCDMA, LTE. An ID for a cell within a given network. Valid GSM IDs range from 0 to 65535 while WCDMA and LTE allow integers up to 2147483647. In all three connection types, the maximum valid value represents unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>lac</em></td>
<td>GSM, WCDMA. A 16-bit integer representing a cell's location within a given operator's system. 65535 represents unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>psc</em></td>
<td>GSM, WCDMA. Primary Scrambling Code. Valid values range from 0 to 512 with 65535 representing unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>asu_level</em></td>
<td>Arbitrary Strength Unit. This value is proportional to the device's signal strength, but the calculation for determining the actual signal strength varies by connection type. The valid value range for GSM and WCDMA is 0 to 31 while CDMA and LTE have a valid range of 0 to 97, with 99 representing unknown across all connection types. For more information on ASU and calculating true signal strength, please see 3GPP RSRP document GPP 27.007 (Ver 10.3.0) Sec 8.69.</td>
